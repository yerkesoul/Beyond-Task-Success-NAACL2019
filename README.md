# Replication of the Visually-Grounded Dialogue State Encoder (GDSE) 
This repository contains code for the NAACL 2019 paper which was slightly modified by Yerkezhan Abdullayeva and Yan Weiser (University of Potsdam) in the scope of the project module 'Language, Vision and Interaction' lead by [Prof. D. Schlangen](https://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~das/).  

The paper can be found here:

# Setup
All code was developed and tested on Windows 10 with Python 3.8 and [PyTorch 1.12.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). 

# Code Organisation
The code is organised in the following main directories: 


```
---bin
---config 
---data
---logs
---models
---train
---utils
    |---datasets
```

```
---bin
```
This folder contains the PyTorch binary files for the models. This folder is further has three subfolders SL, CL and Oracle. SL folder already has the best pretrained SL models, **SL**. 

```
---config
```
This folder contains JSON files which define hyperparameters, experiment configurations, etc.

```
---data
```
This folder should have all the data files like training data files, vocabulary etc. Originally, you would place all the data from [guesswhat.ai](http://guesswhat.ai) in its original format here. Unfortunately this data is no longer available and we instead used the GuessWhat? data available [here](https://github.com/GuessWhatGame/guesswhat#data). This file currently only contains catid2str.json and the rest of the files will be created as and when training scripts are invoked. Note: This folder is made for convenience and can be removed. In such a case appropriate path should be given in the config files.

```
---logs
```
This folder will contain all the tensorboard and text logging from the model. This further has three subfolders namely CL, GamePlay and SL.

```
---models
```
This folder contains the definition of all models, i.e. parameters and forward-pass.
```
---train
```
This folder contains the scripts for training and inference of the model. This further has four subfolders namely CL, GamePlay(inference code), Oracle and SL. Oracle folder contains the code for training the baseline model. This is where all comes together: The experiment configuration is loaded from the respective JSON file (config); the model is instantiated with the defined hyperparameters; a dataset iterator is defined and eventually the training is performed.

```
---utils
```
This contains various functions which are used throughout the code (mainly in training and data preprocessing).

```
---utils/datasets
```
Contains dataset subclasses for each training method, inference and Oracle. Every dataset has a function to perform preprocessing on the original GuessWhat?! data and store the result in a JSON file. Thereby, preprocessing has only to be done once. This further has four subfolders namely CL, GamePlay, Oracle and SL. 

# Training

The procedure for training your own models [is described here](TRAINING.md)
